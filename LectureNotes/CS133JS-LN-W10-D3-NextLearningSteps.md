## Continue to Learn!

- Register for CS 233JS, Intermediate Programming: JavaScript if you haven't already.
- Register for next term's Sofware Development classes (see this week's [overview and announcements](CS133JS-LN-W10-D0-Announcements.html) for recommendations).
- Don't Forget JavaScript over the Break. Do projects, tutorials and free courses&mdash;suggestions are listed below.

### Projects

- Find project tutorials on the internet&mdash;like these: [40 JavaScript Projects for Beginners – Easy Ideas to Get Started Coding JS](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-projects-for-beginners/#how-to-create-a-color-flipper). Some of these project tutorials will walk you through coding the project and show you all the code. It's better to try to figure out how to do the project yourself and then only watch the "walk through", or look at the code if you get stuck. The more you can do your own problem solving and use your own creativity the better.

- Dream up your own projects. Here are some ideas:

  - Games: dice or card games, tic-tac-toe, checkers or chess, memory, etc.
  - Puzzles: Sudoku, picture puzzle (sliding picture tiles), cross-word, etc.
  - Interactive photo gallery, video, or music site, etc.
  - Your own ideas&mdash;these are the best!
  
- Do the projects in *Eloquent JavaScript*. Each successive project is more challenging and will require you to read more of the book and learn more JavaScript. 

  You already know almost everything you need to know for the first project, the Robot.

  - [Robot project](https://eloquentjavascript.net/07_robot.html)
  - [A Programming Language](https://eloquentjavascript.net/12_language.html)
  - [A Platform Game](https://eloquentjavascript.net/16_game.html)
  - [A Pixel Art Editor](https://eloquentjavascript.net/19_paint.html)
  - [A Skill Sharing Web Site](https://eloquentjavascript.net/21_skillsharing.html)

### LinkedIn Learning

The college has a subscription to [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning-login/continue?account=88355058&forceAccount=false&authModeName=LaneSAML&authUUID=ZG0W38TeRvKNJgtIUiNCMA%3D%3D&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Flearning%2F) (formerly known as Linda.com) which provides many great self-study programming courses, including [JavaScript](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/topics/javascript?u=88355058). LCC faculty, staff, and students can take the courses free of charge.

### FreeCodeCamp

> Our mission: to help people learn to code for free. We accomplish this  by creating thousands of videos, articles, and interactive coding  lessons - all freely available to the public.

[Full Stack Developer Curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/) on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
These three courses are part of the Full Stack curriculum:
