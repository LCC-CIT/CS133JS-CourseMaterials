## Course Description

This course provides students who have working knowledge of HTML with the concepts and skills required to create dynamic, interactive web pages using client side JavaScript. Through lectures, demonstrations and independent hands-on activities students will learn fundamental programming concepts and will learn about variables, operators, functions, control structures, arrays, pre-defined objects, and event handling in JavaScript. 

 

## Learning Outcome

The intention of the course is to enable you to create and maintain interactive web pages containing JavaScript that might be part of any web site using modern technologies and tools.

## Assessment and Grading

The table below summarizes the possible points for each assessment task as well as the course as a whole:

| **Assessment Tasks**               | **Points Each**          | **Total Points** |

<sup>2</sup> The lowest grades for code reviews, and reading quizzes will be dropped from the grade calculation.

Letter grades for the course will be determined by the following percentages:                  

|       | **+**     |          | **-**    |
| ----- | --------- | -------- | -------- |
| **A** | 100 to 98 | 97 to 92 | 91 to 90 |
| **B** | 89 to 88  | 87 to 82 | 81 to 80 |
| **C** | 79 to 78  | 77 to 72 | 71 to 70 |
| **D** | 69 to 68  | 67 to 62 | 61 to 60 |
| **F** | Below 60  |          |          |

 

### Code Reviews

Students will work in groups of two or three, to review the *beta* versions of each other’s lab assignment solutions. The code review does not affect the grade of the student whose work is being reviewed. Students will use the feedback provided on the code review form to revise their code prior to submitting the *production* version of their software solution.

### Academic Honesty

While students are encouraged to discuss labs and to use each other as resources, each student is responsible for his/her own work. In other words you can help each other, but you can’t copy any part of someone else’s work. The end product must be each student’s own individual work.

### Participation and Attendance

Participation in class discussions and exercises as well as collaboration with your lab partner will be assessed by the instructor. 

Class attendance is part of your participation score and is essential for successful completion of the class. Students who participate via Zoom need to have their cameras on and join the discussion by typing in the chat or turning on their microphones.

Students who miss a class are responsible for obtaining the content provided in class and learning it. Recordings of the Zoom meetings will be provided.

### No Show Drop

The college’s “no show, drop” policy requires that: during the first week students must complete at least one activity (a quiz or assignment) otherwise the student will be dropped from the class.

### Late Work

- Grades for lab production versions submitted after the due date will be reduced by 10%.
- No late assignments may be submitted after week 10.
- Code reviews, quizzes and exams cannot be taken after the due date. 
  Plan ahead! Exceptions will only be made for illness or emergency situations.
