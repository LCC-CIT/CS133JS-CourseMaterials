## Course Structure

This course is broken into weekly modules. The modules start on  Sunday and end on the following Saturday. Every week is broken into  three sections: Overview, Resources, and Activities.

![Screenshot of a sample week in a course](https://classes.lanecc.edu/pluginfile.php/3959899/mod_book/chapter/163181/CourseStructure.png)

### Overview

Each week includes an overview page that must be read before  reviewing the resources and completing the assigned activities. The  overview will include an introduction to the week's topics, a list of  the week's learning objectives, a list of required and supplemental  resources, and detailed instructions for any activities and assignments.

### Resources

Resources will be listed under Required and Supplemental subheadings. Reviewing required resources is mandatory. Supplemental resources are  suggested if you want to get additional information about a topic.  Resources may include links to online articles, text listing offline  reading assignments, PDFs, PowerPoints, videos, interactive  presentations, or additional file types.

### Activities

Activities are required unless they are specifically marked as  optional. Activities may include written assignments, video assignments, forums, quizzes, exams, interactive simulations, wikis, presentations,  or other participatory activities.

**Lab assignments**
Each week you will have a lab  assignment. This is a hands-on programming assignment which you may  complete in the CIT lab (building 19, room 135) or on your own.

**[Lab Partners](https://classes.lanecc.edu/mod/resource/view.php?id=1578908)
**Each of you have been assigned to a lab partner group in Moodle. The groups  are numbered Group 01, 02, etc. There are three versions of each lab  assignment, versions A, B, and C. Each lab partner will be given a  different version. This allows each student to look at the other’s work  and give them help without seeing a solution to their own assignment.

**Getting and Giving a Code Review**
When you have a  beta (draft) version of you lab assignment ready, you will post it in  the Lab Beta + Discussion forum in the Moodle module for the current  week. This must be done before the due date for the beta version. Your  partner will then check your work and complete the "Beta" column of the  code review form. This must be done before the due date for the code  review.

You will also do a code review for one of your [lab partners](https://classes.lanecc.edu/mod/resource/view.php?id=1578908). Use the code review form posted in the Moodle module for the current week.

**What to Do with the Code Review You Get
**Your lab  partner gives you a code review, a you may revise your lab work and then fill out the "Production" column of the code review form to indicate  your revisions. You will then upload the release version of your lab  work to Moodle along with the completed code review form.



**What to Do If Something Goes Wrong**

- Q: What if my lab partner didn’t post a beta version for me to review?
  A: Communicate with them and find out when they will have a beta version  ready. Remind them that a beta version doesn’t need to be fully  complete. Review their code for them when they send it. As long as you  review your partner’s code before the due date for the final version,  your review won’t be counted late.
- Q: What if I have already communicated with my lab partner and they  haven’t responded or they have said they won’t be posting a beta version anytime soon?
  A: You can do a code review for someone else. Or, you  can post an offer in the class Q and A forum to see if anyone wants an  additional review of their most recent lab.
- Q: What if my lab partner didn’t send me a code review by the deadline?
  As long as you have already posted your beta version, you can review your  own code and put a note in the comments section saying your partner  didn't give you a review by the deadline.

**Additional Questions**

- Q: Can I do a code review for someone else in addition to my lab partner? 
  A: Sure, it is good experience for you and helpful for the other person.  They just need to have done a different assignment than the one you  did. 
- Q: Can I get more than one code review for a particular lab? 
  A:  Sure, it’s fine for someone else, in addition to your lab partner, to  review your code. As long as they didn’t do the same assignment that you did. 

## On-line Course Communication

All course communication (via e-mail, Moodle Messages, discussion  forums, video chat, etc.) should be clear, concise, and respectful.  Written communication should use complete sentences with standard  spelling and grammar, including proper capitalization and punctuation.

[The Core Rules of Netiquette](http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html) is a guide to the proper protocol for participating in online classes and writing emails.

Questions about the course should be posted to the [Course Q & A Forum](https://classes.lanecc.edu/mod/hsuforum/view.php?id=2517824). Questions of a more personal nature, such as grades or extensions,  should be sent to your instructor via e-mail. E-mails to your instructor or e-mails to another department regarding support issues should  include your course number and section.

All course announcements will be posted by the instructor to the [News and Announcements Forum](https://classes.lanecc.edu/mod/forum/view.php?id=2472778). Students are expected to check the News Forum on a daily basis. Any  questions about News Forum announcements should be asked in the [Course Q & A Forum](https://classes.lanecc.edu/mod/hsuforum/view.php?id=2517824).

On-line learning provides you with all kinds of freedom and  flexibility BUT it also requires good organizational skills and self  discipline/motivation. 

Here are some tips to keep in mind as you plan your study strategies:

- You will also need a high speed Internet connection to take  advantage of all of the course materials, specifically the streaming  video of my lectures and Acrobat Connect for on-line office hours with  me.

- You will have to teach yourself the content of the course from the materials and activities I provide.

- - You should plan on reading the textbook and the lecture notes.
  - I'll provide you with screen casts that introduce each topic.  I'll also provide you with screen casts of any information that is not  in the textbook. You should plan on watching all of the screen casts  that I provide.
  - You should plan on spending at least 3 hours each week  "introducing yourself to the content" for the week. I'd encourage you  to read the chapter, doing each step in the tutorial as described in the text, and to take the reading quiz prior to beginning the rest of the  lab activity for each topic.

- Lab activity review and case problem allow you to demonstrate  your understanding of the concepts and skills introduced in the  tutorial. Each is a necessary part of the learning process. I would  expect you to spend at least 6 hours each week working on the review and case problems in the lab assignments.

- - Some of the lab assignments involve forum participation or  blog posts. 20% of the grade in those labs is based on participation  only ... not the content of your post ... provided that you are making a reasonable attempt to participate.

- - Each lab assignment has a due date. I will not deduct points  for late lab assignments but you should make every attempt to complete  the assignments on time in order to maximize your ability to learn from  the assignments. Instructions for completing and submitting each lab  assignment are provided with each lab.

- Each quiz is open for several days and will ONLY be available  during the posted time. At least one practice quiz is provided for each  quiz and is available only BEFORE the quiz. All quizzes are open  "resource" and are limited to 120 minutes and one attempt.

- There are lots of ways to give and get help.

- - Student feedback and assistance is available in the forum for each lab/quiz.
  - [Tutoring help](https://classes.lanecc.edu/mod/page/view.php?id=1470806) is available for lab assignments and practice quizzes in the CIT Main lab (building 19 room 135).
  - I am available to answer questions about your labs assignments and practice quizzes: in the forum for that lab/quiz, via email and via on-line office hours. See [Contacting Me](https://classes.lanecc.edu/mod/page/view.php?id=1470805).
