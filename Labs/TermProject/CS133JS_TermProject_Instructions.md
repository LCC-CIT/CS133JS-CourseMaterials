<h1>Term Project</h1


**CS 133JS, Beginning Programming: JavaScript**

## Objectives

This is your oportunity to practice and demostrate all the programming and problem solving concepts you've learned this term.

## Project Requirements

You can choose a project from the list of suggestions below or propose one based on an idea of your own. 

- The project should:
  -  Use all the main programming concepts you've learned in the class:
    - Selection
    - Repetition
    - Functions
    - Arrays
    - Objects
    - Events
  - Use best coding practices like avoiding global variables, writing DRY code, proper indentation, descriptive variable names, explanatory comments, separating I/O from processing, etc.
  - Provide good user experience by using input validation, do-again loops or resets, clear instructions and/or prompts, etc.
  - Require at least as much effort as an average lab assignment, but not as much as two lab assignments.
  
  - Not be the same as any of the class or textbook examples.
  - Not be the same as a project being done by another student in the class.
  - Not use code you got from someone else, the internet, or AI.

## Project Suggestions

- Dice games like "pig" (but somthing more complicated than "craps").
- Grid based games like "tic-tac-toe", including turn-taking and score keeping (nothing as complicated as chess though).
- A text based game like "Hunt the Wumpus".

- A score keeping app for a more complex game like D&D.
- A flash card app like "quizlet".
- An exercise and fitness tracker with features for setting goals, calculating calories burned, heart points, BMI, etc.
- A diet and nutrition tracker with multiple features.
- Your own idea.

## Submission

Each student will post a beta (draft) version in a forum so that you can get and give a code review before submitting the production (final) version.

You will submit:

- A beta version.
- The code review you did for another student.
- The production version of your project along with an updated copy of the code review you recieved.
