         This is not the way you would really generate content in a real web site! -->
    <script>
        var myState = "Oregon";  // Storing a string in a variable
        var width = 560; // This will be used to set the width and height of the video frame
        var video = "https://www.youtube.com/embed/5K3w7CKkeOQ";  // Storing a URL in a variable
        document.write("<h1>My State:" + myState + "</h1>");  // Putting a heading on the page
        document.write("<iframe width='" + width + "' height='" + width / 1.77 + "' src='" + video + "'></iframe>"); // Putting an embedded YouTube video on the page
        document.write("<h2>Coming Home (" + myState + ")</h2>"); // Putting a heading under the video
    </script>
    <!--The tricky part of this is getting the quotation marks right.
        I used double quotes around each string that will be
        sent to the web page by document.write (three strings, one passed to each document.write function). 
        Inside each of those strings, I used single quotes for things that
        the rules of HTML reqire us to put in quotes.
