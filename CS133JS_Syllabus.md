## Course Description

This course provides students who have working knowledge of HTML with the concepts and skills required to create dynamic, interactive web pages using client side JavaScript. Through lectures, demonstrations and independent hands-on activities students will learn fundamental programming concepts and will learn about variables, operators, functions, control structures, arrays, pre-defined objects, and event handling in JavaScript. Students will also be introduced to jQuery, a popular JavaScript framework.

 

## Learning Outcome

The intention of the course is to enable you to create and maintain interactive pages containing client side script that might be part of any web site using modern technologies and tools.

## Learning Resources

 

#### Texts                                                           

Required: *HTML, CSS and Dynamic HTML* *Comprehensive* by Patrick Carey and a jQuery text (*Developing Web Pages with jQuery* by Gosselin). It is a good introduction to the concepts associated with the creation of interactive web sites as well syntax of JavaScript and jQuery. 

Optional: *Eloquent JavaScript: A Modern Introduction to Programming* by Marijn Haverbeke. 

 

#### Web Sites

Moodle is the learning management system used for this course; LCC’s Moodle site is at: [classes.lanecc.edu](https://classes.lanecc.edu). 

The web host where you will publish your programming lab assignments is [citstudent.lanecc.edu](http://citstudent.lanecc.edu). This is the same web server that you used in your html class. Please send your instructor an email message if you have not used this server before and need your user id and password.

 

#### Software

The minimum hardware and software required for programming using JavaScript is discussed in Tutorial 10 of the textbook, Programming with JavaScript. The ideal development platform involves a web client machine running:

- An appropriate operating system. Windows 7 is installed on the machines on campus but you can use Windows 10, any recent version of the Mac OS, or Linux to do your work for class.
- A code (text) editor to create and edit your web pages and JavaScript files. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a free editor that can be downloaded via the internet and used on Windows, OS X (Mac OS) or Linux. Alternatively, you can use [TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/) on OS X, or [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) on Windows.
- At least two modern browsers to view/test your web pages. The latest versions of [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), and [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) can be downloaded via the internet. Many other browsers like Safari, Internet Explorer, and Edge, are also suitable for your use in this class.
- An ftp client to upload your web pages to citstudent.lanecc.edu. [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) is a free ftp client that can be downloaded via the internet and used on Windows, OS X, or Linux. Alternatively, you can use [CyberDuck](https://cyberduck.io/) on OS X or [CoreFTP](http://coreftp.com/) on Windows.

 

#### CIT Computer Lab

The hardware and software required for the course is available to all students in the CIT Main Lab in building 19, room 135. You paid a fee when you registered for this course that provides you with unlimited access to CIT lab facilities. 

 

#### Azure Dev Tools for Teaching

 LCC has a subscription to [Microsoft Imagine](https://e5.onthehub.com/WebStore/Welcome.aspx?ws=ec37ad18-ed9b-e011-969d-0030487d8897) (formerly Microsoft Dream Spark) which provides students with free software. Your instructor will provide you with an opportunity to enroll in Imagine. None of the software offered through Imagine is required for this class, but you may want to take advantage of the offer of free software.

 

#### Assessment and Grading

The table below summarizes the possible points for each assessment task as well as the course as a whole:

 

| **Assessment Tasks**       | **Points Each** | **Total Points** |
| -------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Labs  1 - 9                | 40              | 360              |
| Code  Reviews 1 - 9        | 10              | 90               |
| Reading  Quizzes 1 - 9     | 10              | 90               |
| Midterm  and Final Quizzes | 100             | 200              |
| Term  Project              | 260             | 260              |
| **Course Total**           |                 | **1000**         |

 

Letter grades for the course will be determined by the following percentages:                  

|       | **+**    |           | **-**    |
| ----- | -------- | --------- | -------- |
| *A*   |          | 100 to 92 | 91 to 90 |
| **B** | 89 to 88 | 87 to 82  | 81 to 80 |
| **C** | 79 to 78 | 77 to 72  | 71 to 70 |
| **D** | 69 to 68 | 67 to 62  | 61 to 60 |
| **F** | Below 60 |           |          |

 

#### Code Reviews

Students will work in groups of two or three, to review the *beta* version of each other’s lab assignment solutions. The code review does not affect the grade of the student whose work is being reviewed. Students will use the feedback provided on the code review form to revise their code prior to submitting the *production* version of their software solution.

#### Academic Honesty

While students are encouraged to discuss labs and to use each other as resources, each student is responsible for his/her own work. In other words you can help each other, but you can’t copy any part of someone else’s work. The end product must be each student’s own individual work.

#### Attendance

Class attendance is not graded but will be essential for successful completion of the class. Students who miss a class are responsible for obtaining the course content provided in class and mastering it. 

#### No Show Drop

The college’s “no show, drop” policy requires that: during the first week, on-campus students must physically attend at least one class session. Online students must complete at least one activity (a quiz or assignment) otherwise the student will be dropped from the class.

#### Late Work

·   Grades for code reviews will be reduced by 20% if either the beta version or the code review is submitted late.

·   Grades for lab production versions submitted after the due date will be reduced by 10%

·    Quizzes and exams cannot be taken after the due date. Plan ahead! Exceptions will only be made for illness or emergency situations.

 

#### Accessibility and Accommodations

To request assistance or accommodations related to disability, contact Disability Resources at [(541) 463-5150](tel:541-463-5150) (voice), 711 (TTY), disabilityresources@lanecc.edu (e-mail), or stop by Building 1, Room 218.
