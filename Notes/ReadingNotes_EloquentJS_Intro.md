## Introduction

Reference to BASIC and DOS prompts of the 80s and 90s--My not be understood.

### On Programming

He describes "best practices" as if he thinks they are recipes that stifle creativity. He says you can't learn to write good code from a list of rules. I disagree.

### Why Language Matters

Nice example of an algorithm in pseudo-code (although he doesn't use those terms) that goes with the binary machine code listing.

The discussion of the pseudo-code to add the numbers 1 through 10 is pretty detailed. Tell students they just need to get the gist of it not the details. In fact, they can skip to "the moral of the story " at the bottom of page 5.

### What is JavaScript?

He says that when he first wrote code in JS, he despised it! This was because if it not be rigid, not strongly typed. Maybe we shouldn't look at this as a shortcoming, but just a different paradigm.

### Code and What to Do with It
