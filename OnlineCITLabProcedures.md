## After Hours (non-emergency questions)

If it's after 5:00 pm, or if a challenge isn’t immediate, or if a student sees the chat is full and doesn’t want to wait, use the link below and fill out the Google form. Your questions will be answered in the order received. If the question is received after 5:00 pm, it will be answered on the following business day.

## Expectations

- Be patient.

- Be ready to engage with us in solving the immediate challenge.

  We expect to have other people that need our help and if the student isn’t ready when we are,  we will move to the next person who needs our help.

- Have your volume on, and be ready to talk and share your screen.

  We are used to talking and will want to talk through the challenge with the students. It is faster  and more efficient for communicating with one person than typing.

- We expect to only be able to assist with one challenge at a time, and then we will need to move on to   the next person that needs our help.

  It is unlikely that we will have the bandwidth to work with a student through an entire exercise,  and if that level of assistance is needed we ask that you reach out to your instructor.

- Be polite.

  We will do our best to get to each student as quickly as possible, and to help to the best of our  ability. If solutions don’t come easily and quickly we understand that it can be frustrating&mdash;we ask that the frustration doesn’t get taken out on us.
