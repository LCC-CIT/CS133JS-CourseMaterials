            <p>Communication occurs long before speech. Babies communicate 
               with their parents through crying, laughter, smiling and 
               pointing. The attentive parent quickly becomes attuned to 
               this "non-speech" communication. Usually in the second year of 
               life, babies will begin to add single words to these acts 
               of expression. A baby will point to a cup and say, "drink."
               The names "Mama" and "Dada" are among the first out of a
               baby's mouth.
            </p>
            <p>As the child gets older, he or she will add new words to 
               these expressions and will begin to use words in 
               combination: "get drink me." The parents provide visual
               and audio feedback to the child, encouraging the development 
               of speech. Through a process called echoing, parents 
               will naturally repeat what their child says, providing an 
               important confirmation that what the child has said has 
               been heard and understood.
            </p>
            <p>With twins, the situation may be slightly different. 
               Often parents cannot provide the one-to-one feedback that 
               single children routinely enjoy. It may be that the one 
               providing most of the feedback is the other twin!
            </p>
            <p>While the other twin is usually a very attentive and 
               eager audience, he or she cannot provide the type of 
               feedback needed for language development. Twins
               cannot correct each other's mistakes in the use of words 
               or grammar. Moreover, by communicating with each other, 
               twins are necessarily decreasing the amount of communication 
               with adults and older children. In some cases, twins become 
               such good audiences for each other, they lose interest
               in communicating with their parents!
            </p>
            <p>In rare cases, this one-to-one communication can progress 
               to the point at which a shared language is created. 
               The twins will come up with their own words, and in some 
               cases, their own grammatical structures. The languages
               are unintelligible to anyone else but the twins. These cases 
               are very rare, even though they are well publicized. 
               The twin's secret language will usually disappear by age 
               4 or 5, as they become more adept at using their
               parent's language.
            </p>
            <p>What can you do to help your twins in acquiring 
               language? The most important thing you can do is pay 
               individual attention to each child. Easier said than
               done! Provide feedback to each child as he or she gropes 
               with language. If you are feeding your twins, talk to one 
               child as the other is eating. Then, when the first child 
               is eating, switch to the second. When changing
               diapers, use the one-on-one time (one hopes) to further 
               provide the audio clues needed for learning language.
            </p>
            <p>As with everything that is twin-related, language 
               acquisition requires some extra work on the part of the 
               parents; but again with twin-related activities,
               the extra work is paid off in extra fun.
