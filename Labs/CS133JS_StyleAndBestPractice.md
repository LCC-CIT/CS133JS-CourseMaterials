## Coding Conventions for this Course

- Indentation: use standard indentation.

  - Many JS style guides reccomend indenting by two spaces.

- Variables

  - Names should be descriptive.
  - Names should use camelCase.
  - Should be declared with `let`.
  - Use strict mode (`"use strict";`)

- Constants

  - Declared with `const`.

  - Names should be descriptive.

  - Names should be in ALL_CAPS.

  - Should be used in place of literals.

- Code should be DRY&mdash;Don't Repeat Yourself.

  (No duplicated blocks of code).

- Separation of concerns.  
  Functions that do processing should not also do i/o.

- Functions

  - Names should be descriptive and use camelCase.
  - Should have at most one return statement.
  - Should have a single purpose.

- Old code: any unused code should be removed.

- Comments: explanatory comments should be included.
