I noticed you have been a bit quiet on Discord and haven't submitted the lab 2 assignment yet. Please get in touch and let me know how I can help you with this class.

You can still submit this assignment for 90% credit. Please let me know what I can do to help you get this done.

When you don't have code from a lab partner to review you can either:

Post in the general channel on Discord and ask if someone who did a different version of the lab assignment will exchange code reviews with you.

Or do a self review.

Excellent job on the code review for your lab partner. It is complete, accurate and you provided good feedback.
