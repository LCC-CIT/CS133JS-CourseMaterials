# Introduction

## Announcements

- Note: the tutorial you are reading has examples that use *arrow functions*. You will learn about those next term. I've translated those example to use "normal" functions.
  
- Reminder: Lab 6 (objects) code reviews are due tomorrow.

- No class next Monday, it's Memorial day.

## Q and A

- Any questions?



# Web Page Input and Output

**A brief introduction**

## What is the DOM?

The browser has a set of built-in JavaScript objects that represent the web page and all its HTML elements. The objects are arranged in a hierarchy:

![DOM-model](../Images/DOM-model.svg)

By <a href="//commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Eib&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Eib (page does not exist)">Birger Eriksson</a> - <span class="int-own-work" lang="en">Own work</span>, <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0" title="Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0">CC BY-SA 3.0</a>, <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=18034500">Link</a>



**HTML for the web page in the DOM diagram above**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>My title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>A heading</h1>
    <a href="https://example.com">Link text</a>
  </body>  
</html>
```



## Referencing HTML Elements

We can reference elements directly through the DOM tree, like this:

```javascript
document.body.children[0].innerHTML = "Dom Demo"; // Change the h1 element
```

But usually, we use some method to search for an element by id, selector or some other identifying feature.

For the examples below, assume we have this in our web page:

```HTML
<h1>Greetings</h1>
<p id="eugene">Hello Eugene!</p>
<p id="lcc">Hello LCC!</p>
<p id="cit">Hello CIT!</p>
```

### By id attribute

```javascript
document.getElementById("lcc").innerHTML = "Hello Lane Community College!";
```

### By CSS selector

#### Using `querySelector` with a single selector

Review: in a CSS rule, the first part is the selector. For example, in the rule below, `#cit` is the selector:

```css
#cit {
	background-color: green;
}
```

In JavaScript, we can use `document.querySelector` to get a reference to an HTML element.

- The selector can be any valid CSS selector such as:

  - id
  - class
  - element name (tag name)
  - or a combination of the selectors above
  
- The `querySelector` method will return a single reference to the first matching element it finds on the page. 

  ```javascript
  document.querySelector("#cit").innerHTML = "Greetings CIT!";
  ```

#### Using `querySelector` with multiple selectors

For the html below,

```html
<h1>Students and Their Degree Programs</h1>
<ul>
        <li id="s1">
            Student: <span></span>
            <p>Degree: <span></span></p>  
        </li>
        <li id="s2">
            Student: <span></span>
            <p>Degree: <span></span></p>  
       </li>
</ul>
```

In the JavaScript example below, we are using the selectors being passed to the `querySelector` method to put text into the spans.

```javascript
document.querySelector("#s1 span").innerHTML = "Susan Lee";
document.querySelector("#s1 p span").innerHTML = "Computer Programming";

document.querySelector("#s2 span").innerHTML = "David Johnson";
document.querySelector("#s2 p span").innerHTML = "Computer Network Operations";
```



## I/O Using HTML Elements

In previous examples and lab assignments you've used the `prompt` function to get input `document.write`, or `getElementById` with `innerHTML` to put output on a web page.

Now we'll look at a couple new ways to do input and output (I/O).

### `textContent`

This is another way to access the content between tags. The difference between this property and `innerHTML` is that `textContent` just gets or set text, no HTML tags will be processed and no formatting done on the web page.  Here's an example showing the differences: 

[Demo of innerHTML vs. textConent](../Examples/Week08/Demo-innerHtmlVsTextContent.html)

The `textContent` property is the best one to use when you just need to output text (without HTML tags) to a web page.

### `value`

This object property is useful for getting or setting the value in an HTML `<input>` element. The input element would normally be in an HTML form.

```html
<input id="name" placeholder="Your name">
<script>
  alert(document.getElementById("name").value);
  // The alert will display "Your name"
</script>
```



## JavaScript Events

JavaScript can respond to various actions a user preforms when interacting with a web page in a browser. These user actions are called *events*.

### Common events

- onclick                 The user clicks an HTML element.
- onmouseover     The mouse pointer moves over an HTML element.
- onkeydown         The user presses a keyboard key.
- onload                 The browser has finished loading the page.

### Event Handlers

Event handlers are JavaScript functions that are called when events occur. 

- The event handler must be specified for a particular HTML element.

  One way to do this is with an HTML attribute:

  ```html
  <p onmouseover="doSomething()">This paragraph has an onmouseover event</p>
  ```


- An event handler is just an ordinary function:

  ```javascript
  function doSomething() {
     document.write("something");
  }
  ```

- Event handlers that write something to the document (web page) need to have a target element. 

  ```javascript
  function doSomething() {
     document.querySelector("p").innerHTML = "Something";
  }
  ```

### Using a Button to Get Input

We can use a button with an onclick event handler to get user input. Here's an example:

```html
Enter your name:<input>
<button onclick="getName()">Enter</button>

<p>Hello: <span id="name"></span></p>
<script>
  function getName() {
    let name = document.querySelector("input").value;
    document.querySelector("#name").innerHTML = name;
  }
</script>
```

Note: The `onclick` event can be used with any element, but we frequently use it with a button. 

## When to Use an HTML `<form>`

The purpose of a `<form>` is to send the information entered in the form to a program running on a server. Only use a form if that is what you want to do. If you are just using input elements with JavaScript running in the browser, don't put the input elements in a form.

When you click a button on a form, the information entered on the form will be sent in an HTTP request either to a program at a URL specified in the form's *action* attribute or back to the URL of the web page the form is in&mdash;this is called a *postback*. A postback will reset the web page to its original state and any information entered on the form will be lost.
