	<h1>Using document.write to put html on your web page</h1>
	Here is a plain old HTML hyperlink: <br />
	<a href="http://lanecc.edu" target="_blank">Lane Community College</a>
	<br />
	<br />
	Here is the same link writen using document.write.<br />
	We wouldn't normally use document.write to do this (because it just make something easy complicated),
	but I'm just trying to show you how to use this function to write HTML to your web page.<br />
	<script type="text/javascript">
		document.write("<a href='http://lanecc.edu' target='_blank'>Lane Community College</a>");
	</script>
	<br />
	Notice that we just put the whole html element inside quotes and put that inside the parethesis at the end of document.write.
	This is because document.write requires us to dp that. Any text (as opposed to variables or numbers) we put inside the parethesis
	has to be in quotes. And, HTML is just text. But, there are quotes inside our HTML anchor tag, so, to avoid confusing document.write
	we have to change those quotes to single quotes- and that's what we did above.
	<br />
	<br />
	Now, we'll add something the URL, and we'll do it by concatenating two strings.
	Again we wouldn't normally do this (we'd just make it all one string), but I think it will be instructive.<br />
	<script type="text/javascript">
		document.write("<a href='http://lanecc.edu" + "/cit'" + "target='_blank'>Lane Community College, CIT Department</a>");
	</script>
	<br />
	The only tricky parts here are that we used the plus sign to join together three strings,
	and we had to put the single quote after <em>cit</em> in the second string. The reason for doing
	the quotes that way is so that when document.write spits out the HTML link element, it will have a quote at
	the end of the URL- this is what the rules of HTML require.
		<br />
	<br />
	Finally, we'll put the second part of the URL in a variable.
	Once again we wouldn't normally do it this way.<br />
	<script type="text/javascript">
		var dept = "cit";
		document.write("<a href='http://lanecc.edu/" + dept + "' target='_blank'>Lane Community College, CIT Department</a>");
	</script>
	<br />
	So, the variable just went where the string had been. But I didn't want the variable to have to put <em>/cit'</em> 
	in the variable (the slash and quote just seem messy), so I put them inside the strings that are being concatenated and
	sent into the document.write function.
	
	<h2>Debugging with the alert dialog box</h2>
	If you are wondering what is really being written to your web page by document.write, you can check it by using an 
	alert dialog box. The aleart dialog box is intended for poping up a window to give a message to your users but you 
	can also use it for debugging (see page HTML 727 in your textbook). For example, lets say you have a document.write statement 
	that is supposed to write an HTML link element, and the link isn't working, but you can't figure out why. 
	It would be useful to see the actual HTML that is being written by document.write. Here's how you 
	can do it- you pass the same string to the alert functioin and see what the resulting text looks like. (I intentionally put an error in this link element.)<br />
	<script type="text/javascript">
		var dept = "cit";
		alert( "<a href='http://lanecc.edu/" + dept + " target='_blank'>Lane Community College, CIT Department</a>");
	</script>
	<br />
	
	Did you find the error? There is a missing quote. I'll put it in and pass the string to the alert funcion again. Does this look better?<br />
		<script type="text/javascript">
		var dept = "cit";
		alert( "<a href='http://lanecc.edu/" + dept + "' target='_blank'>Lane Community College, CIT Department</a>");
	</script>
	<br />
	<br />
	You can also use alert to show what's stored in a varaible, as shown in our textbook. Let's try that. First we'll put the whole string above into a variable, then we'll display it.
		<script type="text/javascript">
		var dept = "cit";
		var lccLink = "<a href='http://lanecc.edu/" + dept + "' target='_blank'>Lane Community College, CIT Department</a>";
		alert( lccLink);
		document.write("<br/>And we can also use this variable in document.write to create a link:<br />");
		document.write(lccLink);
	</script>
	<br />
	<br />
