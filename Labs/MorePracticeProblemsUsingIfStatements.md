<h1>More Practice Problems Using if Statements</h1>

1. Write a program that checks if a given number is positive, negative, or zero. If the number is positive, print "The number is positive". If it is negative, print "The number is negative". If it is zero, print "The number is zero".
2. Write a program that takes two numbers as input and prints the larger number. If the two numbers are equal, print "The numbers are equal".
3. Write a program that takes a number as input and checks if it is even or odd. If it is even, print "The number is even". If it is odd, print "The number is odd".
4. Write a program that takes a string as input and checks if it is a palindrome (i.e., if it reads the same backwards as forwards). If it is a palindrome, print "The string is a palindrome". If it is not a palindrome, print "The string is not a palindrome".
5. Write a program that takes a number as input and checks if it is a multiple of 3 and/or 5. If it is a multiple of 3, print "The number is a multiple of 3". If it is a multiple of 5, print "The number is a multiple of 5". If it is a multiple of both 3 and 5, print "The number is a multiple of both 3 and 5". If it is not a multiple of either 3 or 5, print "The number is not a multiple of 3 or 5".
