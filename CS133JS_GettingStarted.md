## Introduction to Moodle

Moodle is the learning management system used by Lane Community College and the way you will interact with the online content of your courses. To learn more about Moodle and how it is used for Lane  Community College courses, please review the course below:

- [Moodle Basics for Students](https://classes.lanecc.edu/course/index.php?categoryid=19)

## Course Structure

This course is broken into weekly modules. The modules start on Sunday and end on Saturday. Every week is broken into  three sections: Overview, Resources, and Activities.

### Overview

Each week includes an overview page for you to read before reviewing the resources and completing the assigned activities. The  overview will include an introduction to the week's topics, a list of  the week's learning objectives and an overview of activities for the week.

### Resources

Learning resources will be listed with links to those that are available online. Resources may include links to online articles, text listing offline  reading assignments,  videos, or other types of learning materials.

### Activities

Learning activities are required unless they are specifically marked as  optional. Activities will include lab assignments, quizzes, or other participatory activities.

#### Lab assignments

Each week you will have a lab  assignment. This is a hands-on programming assignment.

#### Lab Partners

Each of you will be assigned to a lab partner team in Moodle. There are three versions of each lab  assignment. Each lab partner will be given a  different version. This allows each student to look at the otherâ€™s work and give them help and feedback without seeing a solution to their own assignment.

You will review each other's work in "round robin" fashion: student A reviews student B's work, student B reviews C's work and student C reviews A's work.

## On-line Course Communication

All course communication (via e-mail, Discord, Moodle Messages, discussion  forums, video chat, etc.) should be clear, concise, and respectful. Do your best to use complete sentences with standard spelling, grammar and punctuation.

[The Core Rules of Netiquette](http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html) is a guide to the respectful an constructive communication online.

We will be using Discord for communication in this class. See the main Moodle page for more information on the class Discord server. Questions about the course should be posted on Discord in the *Discussion* channel. Questions that relate specifically to you, such as grades or extensions,  should be sent to your instructor via e-mail. E-mails to your instructor or e-mails to another department regarding support issues should  include your course number and section (online vs. hybrid/in person).

All course announcements will be posted by the instructor to the Discord *Announcements* channel. Students are expected to check for announcements regularly (at least every class day). Any  questions about Announcements can be posted on the Discord *Discussion* channel.
