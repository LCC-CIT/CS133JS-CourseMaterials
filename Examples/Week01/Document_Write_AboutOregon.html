    <!--The tricky part of this is getting the quotation marks right.
        I used double quotes around each string that will be
        sent to the web page by document.write (three strings, on passed to each document.write). 
        Inside each of those strings, I used single quotes for things that
        the rules of HTML reqire us to put in quotes.
