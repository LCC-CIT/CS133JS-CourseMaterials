# Preface

The primary audience is people who know JS, but don't know it well.



# Chapter 1: 

This chapter is for people who are beginners and need a crash course in programming before getting into JavaScript, but it actually is a concise introduction to JS as well.

### Operators

The compound assignment, equality, comparison, and logical operators need more explanation.
