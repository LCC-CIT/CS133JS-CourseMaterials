## Introduction to Moodle

Moodle is the learning management system of the Lane Community College and the location where you will be able to view the content of your on-line  courses. To learn more about Moodle and how it is used for Lane  Community College courses, please review the course below:

- [How to Moodle](https://classes.lanecc.edu/course/view.php?id=2637)

## Course Structure

This course is broken into weekly modules. The modules start on Sunday and end on the following Saturday. Every week is broken into  three sections: Overview, Resources, and Activities.

### Overview

Each week includes an overview page that must be read before  reviewing the resources and completing the assigned activities. The  overview will include an introduction to the week's topics, a list of  the week's learning objectives, a list of required and supplemental  resources, and detailed instructions for any activities and assignments.

### Resources

Learning resources will be listed under Required and Supplemental subheadings. Reviewing required resources is mandatory. Supplemental resources are  suggested if you want to get additional information about a topic.  Resources may include links to online articles, text listing offline  reading assignments,  videos, or other types of learning materials.

### Activities

Learning activities are required unless they are specifically marked as  optional. Activities will include lab assignments, quizzes, or other participatory activities.

####Lab assignments

Each week you will have a lab  assignment. This is a hands-on programming assignment.

####Lab Partners

Each of you will be assigned to a lab partner in Moodle. There are two versions of each lab  assignment. Each lab partner will be given a  different version. This allows each student to look at the other’s work and give them help and feedback without seeing a solution to their own assignment.

####Getting and Giving a Code Review

When you have a  beta (draft) version of you lab assignment ready, you will post it in  the Lab Beta + Discussion forum in the Moodle section for the current  week. This must be done before the due date for the beta version. Your lab partner will then check your work and complete the "Beta" column of the  code review form. This must be done before the due date for the code review.

####What to Do with the Code Review You Get

Your lab  partner gives you a code review, a you may revise your lab work and then fill out the "Production" column of the code review form to indicate  your revisions. You will then upload the release version of your lab  work to Moodle along with the completed code review form.

####What to Do If Something Goes Wrong

- Q: What if my lab partner didn’t post a beta version for me to review?
  A: Communicate with them and find out when they will have a beta version  ready. Remind them that a beta version doesn’t need to be fully  complete. Review their code for them when they send it. As long as you  review your partner’s code before the due date for the final version,  your review won’t be counted late.
- Q: What if I have already communicated with my lab partner and they  haven’t responded or they have said they won’t be posting a beta version anytime soon?
  A: You can do a code review for someone else. Or, you  can post an offer in the class Q and A forum to see if anyone wants an  additional review of their most recent lab.
- Q: What if my lab partner didn’t send me a code review by the deadline?
  As long as you have already posted your beta version, you can review your  own code and put a note in the comments section saying your partner  didn't give you a review by the deadline.

####Additional Questions

- Q: Can I do a code review for someone else in addition to my lab partner? 
  A: Sure, it is good experience for you and helpful for the other person.  They just need to have done a different assignment than the one you  did. 
- Q: Can I get more than one code review for a particular lab? 
  A:  Sure, it’s fine for someone else, in addition to your lab partner, to  review your code. As long as they didn’t do the same assignment that you did. 

## On-line Course Communication

All course communication (via e-mail, Moodle Messages, discussion  forums, video chat, etc.) should be clear, concise, and respectful.  Written communication should use complete sentences with standard  spelling and grammar, including proper capitalization and punctuation.

[The Core Rules of Netiquette](http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html) is a guide to the proper protocol for participating in online classes and writing emails.

Questions about the course should be posted to the Course Q & A Forum. Questions of a more personal nature, such as grades or extensions,  should be sent to your instructor via e-mail. E-mails to your instructor or e-mails to another department regarding support issues should  include your course number and section.

All course announcements will be posted by the instructor to the News and Announcements Forum. Students are expected to check the News Forum on a daily basis. Any  questions about News Forum announcements should be asked in the Course Q & A Forum.
