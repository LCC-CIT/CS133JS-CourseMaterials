# Lab 2, Part 1: Function Exercises

For each problem, type the solution code in the console and execute it. Don't clear the console, since you will be copying  everything into a document which you will submit on Moodle.

1. JavaScript is awesome&mdash;a function with no parameters and no return value:

   - Write a definition for a function that pops up an alert that says "JavaScript is awesome!".
