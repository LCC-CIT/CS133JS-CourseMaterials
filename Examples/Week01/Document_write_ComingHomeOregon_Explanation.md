<h1>Explanation of Lab 1 Example Code</h1>

Start by looking at the web page [My State: Oregon](Document_write_ComingHomeOregon.html).  The HTML in this web page is generated by JavaScript running in a `<script>` element. You can see this by using the browser's *view source* feature.

If you use the *inspect* tool in the browser, you will see that this is the HTML that has been generated:

## HTML Generated by the JavaScript

Here is the HTML that will be generated by this code:

```html
<h1>My State: Oregon</h1>
<iframe width="560" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5K3w7CKkeOQ"></iframe>
<h2>Coming Home (Oregon)</h2>
```

## The JavaScript Code 

Here is the JavaScript code that created that HTML:

```javascript
var myState = "Oregon";
var width = 560;
var video = "https://www.youtube.com/embed/5K3w7CKkeOQ"; 
document.write("<h1>My State: " + myState + "</h1>");
document.write("<iframe width='" + width + "' src='" + video + "'></iframe>"); 
document.write("<h2>Coming Home (" + myState + ")</h2>"); 
```

*BTW, we wouldn't normally create a web page this way. This is just a way to practice using some basic JavaScript coding concepts.*

### Explanation of the JavaScript Code

Here is a line-by-line explanation:

- In the first three lines, variables are declared and values stored in them to be used later.

  ```javascript
  var myState = "Oregon";
  var width = 560;
  var video = "https://www.youtube.com/embed/5K3w7CKkeOQ";
  ```

- This line generates the heading:

  ```javascript
  document.write("<h1>My State: " + myState + "</h1>");
  ```
  The main thing to look at is what's inside the parenthesis. It is made up of three parts:

  - `"<h1>My State: "`  a string
  - `myState`  a variable containing a string
  - `"</h1>"` another string

  Once these three parts are joined together using concatenation operators, `+`, the resulting string will be:  
  `<h1>My State: Oregon</h1>`

- **This is the most important part!**  
  This line generates the code for an `iFrame` element containing the embedded YouTube video:

  `document.write("<iframe width='" + width + "' src='" + video + "'></iframe>");`  

  Again, look at the part inside the parenthesis. It has five parts:

  - `"<iframe width='"`  a string. It contains the opening tag for the iframe, the width attribute and `=`.  

    The trickey part of this is that there is a single quote, `'`, inside the string. This is becuase **the `'` will be output to the page**! This is becuase the actual width value needs to have quotes around it. That's just an HTML rule for attribute values.

  - `width` a variable containing the width value.

  - `"' src='"` a string. Again this string contains single quotes, `'` , becuase they need to be output to the page to go around the attribute values. The first one goes after the *width* value, the second one goes before the *src* value.

  - `video` a variable containing the URL (internet address) of the video.

  - `"'></iframe>");`  a string. It contains the closing `'` for the video src value as well as the closing tag for the iframe.

- The last line generates the caption under the iFrame holding the video

  `document.write("<h2>Coming Home (" + myState + ")</h2>"); `  

  There are three parts:

  - `"<h2>Coming Home ("` a string. Note that it contains the opening parenthesis that will go around the state name, Oregon.
  - `myState`  a variable containing the state name.
  - `")</h2>"` a string. Note taht it contains the closing parenthesis that goes after the state name, Oregon.
