<h1>Lab 8, Part 1: Regex Exercises</h1>

**CS 133JS, Beginning Programming: JavaScript**

[TOC]

## Objective

The purpose of this assignment is to get practice using regular expression syntax and to solve simple problems using RegExp objects.

## Instructions

There are two files to use for this exercise. Right click on each link and select "Save link as" to download the files. Please do not rename them.

- [RegExpExercises.html](https://lcc-cit.github.io/CS133JS-CourseMaterials/Labs/Lab08/Part1-RegexExercises/RegExpExercises.html)
- [RegExpExercises.js](https://lcc-cit.github.io/CS133JS-CourseMaterials/Labs/Lab08/Part1-RegexExercises/RegExpExercises.js)

The HTML file contains instructions and code to check the solution to each problem. You will complete the "TODO" parts of the JavaScript file. For this lab, that means writing the regular expressions.

Note that the code in the html file that checks the solutions does not always check every possible right or wrong string, so you need to do some checks on your own to ensure that your regex pattern meets the requirements for each problem.

## Troubleshooting Tips

- If the colors (red or green) disappear, it means you have a syntax error in your .js code.
- Check to browser console for error messages.
- Test each regex in the console where you can easily modify it and check the results.

## Submission

You will submit the two files for this exercise to Moodle along with the files for Part 2. Please do not change the file names.
