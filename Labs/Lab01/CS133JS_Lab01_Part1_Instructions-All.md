<h1>Lab 1, Part 1: <i>You Don't Know JS</i> Exercises</h1>

## Learning Objectives

 The purpose of this lab is to give you practice working with: 

- The browser console
-  JavaScript variables
-  JavaScript operators

## Instructions
1. Using the console of your browser, run all the code examples in the first half of *You Don't Know JS*, [Chapter 1](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/1st-ed/up%20%26%20going/ch1.md)—each example starting with the [Try It Yourself](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/1st-ed/up%20%26%20going/ch1.md#try-it-yourself) section, up through the end of the [Variables](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/1st-ed/up%20%26%20going/ch1.md#variables) section. The “Try It Yourself” section explains how to run the code examples in the browser console.

2. After you run each example in the console, change the instructions that produce output from <code>console.log()</code> to <code>document.write()</code> so that the output goes to the web page instead of the console. copy the code into the [CS133JS_Lab01_Part1.html](https://lcc-cit.github.io/CS133JS-CourseMaterials/Labs/Lab01/CS133JS_Lab01_Part1.html) file.
