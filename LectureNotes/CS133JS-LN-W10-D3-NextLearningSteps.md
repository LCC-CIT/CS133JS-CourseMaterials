## Continue to Learn and Don't Forget JavaScript over the Summer

### Projects

- Find project tutorials on the internet&mdash;like these: [40 JavaScript Projects for Beginners â€“ Easy Ideas to Get Started Coding JS](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-projects-for-beginners/#how-to-create-a-color-flipper). Some of these project tutorials will walk you through coding the project and show you all the code. It's better to try to figure out how to do the project yourself and then only watch the "walk through", or look at the code if you get stuck. The more you can do your own problem solving and use your own creativity the better.

- Dream up your own projects. Here are some ideas:

  - Games: dice or card games, tic-tac-toe, checkers or chess, memory, etc.
  - Puzzles: Sudoku, picture puzzle (sliding picture tiles), cross-word, etc.
  - Interactive photo gallery, video, or music site, etc.
  
- Do the projects in *Eloquent JavaScript*. Each successive project is more challenging and will require you to read more of the book and learn more JavaScript. 

  You already know almost everything you need to know for the first project, the Robot.
