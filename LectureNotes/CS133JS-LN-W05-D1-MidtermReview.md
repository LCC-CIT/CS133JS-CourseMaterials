## Introduction

This week is your opportunity to review all that we've covered in the first four weeks of class&mdash;both as preparation for the midterm quiz as well as a way to firm up what you've learned about JavaScript so far.

Focus on understanding concepts&mdash;not on memorizing answers. The only thing to memorize is some terminology. The rest of what you need to know is how JavaScript works and how to write code.



## About the Quiz

- The quiz will cover material in the lecture notes and required reading from the first four weeks of the term.
- You can refer to textbooks, tutorials, lecture notes and use a browser console during the quiz.
- There will be a two-hour time limit. You will need to take the entire quiz in one session without interuption.
- You are not allowed to search the internet for answers or get help from anyone else.



## What to Review

### Lecture notes

Review all the lecture notes and example code for the class, starting at week 1. If there is anything you are unsure about, copy the example code into a browser console and experiment with it. Modifying code to see what happens a great way to learn!

A good way to get a quick overview of what we covered is to look at the review section on each of the lecture notes.

### Example code

Download the instructor's examples and play with the code. Put breakpoints in it, and before you run it, try to predict what will be in the variables, then run it and when it stops at the breakpoints, see if you were right. Modify the code and experiment.

### Lab assignments

Review the code you wrote for the lab assignments. Make sure you understand how everything works. If there are things you don't understand, look for answers in the required and supplemental readings, lecture notes, or on the web and post questions in the Q and A forum.
