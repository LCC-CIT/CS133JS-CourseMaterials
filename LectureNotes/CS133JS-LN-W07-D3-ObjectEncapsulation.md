## Accessors

We can access the properties of a JavaScript object through special functions called *accessors*. These help us employ a programming concept called *encapsulation*. [TODO: Explain encapsulation.]

There are two kinds of accessors: *getters* and *setters*. One gets the value of a property, the other sets the value of a property. Here is an example in an object literal:

```javascript
const coffeeMaker = 
{ 
    grounds: 8,      // Tablespoons
    water: 32,			 // Ounces
  	set ozOfWater(w) {
    	this.water = w;
  	},
  	get ozOfWater() {
      return this.water;
    },
    brew: function() {
        return this.water + " ounces of coffee is ready!";
    }
};
```
