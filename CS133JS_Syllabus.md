## Course Description

This course provides students who have working knowledge of HTML with the concepts and skills required to create dynamic, interactive web pages using client side JavaScript. Through lectures, demonstrations and independent hands-on activities students will learn fundamental programming concepts and will learn about variables, operators, functions, control structures, arrays, pre-defined objects, and event handling in JavaScript. 

 

## Learning Outcome

The intention of the course is to enable you to create and maintain interactive web pages containing JavaScript that might be part of any web site using modern technologies and tools.

### Quizzes

<u>Reading Quizzes</u>
Weekly quizzes are given that cover the required reading for that week. These quizzes must be taken before the first class meeting of the week. They are "open book" (or whatever reading material was assigned.)

<u>Midterm and Final Quizzes</u>

The midterm and final quizzes are given in weeks 5 and 11. See the course schedule for exact dates and times. Quizzes are "closed book", but students may prepare a 8 1/2" x 11" sheet of notes to refer to during the quiz. These quizzes may be taken either:

- On-campus students (hybrid modality) will take the quiz In the classroom during the normal class time.

- online student will take the quiz In the Instructional Testing Center in the Center Building, room 311. See the [Instructional Testing Services](https://www.lanecc.edu/get-support/academic-support/instructional-testing-services) web site for testing times and procedures.  

  Students who live outside the Eugene/Springfield area can send an email to [online@lanecc.edu](mailto:online@lanecc.edu) well in advance of the test dates to arrange for your midterm and final to be proctored at a location near you.

### Code Reviews

Students will work in groups of two or three, to review the *beta* versions of each other’s lab assignment solutions. The code review does not affect the grade of the student whose work is being reviewed. Students will use the feedback provided on the code review form to revise their code prior to submitting the *production* version of their software solution.

### Academic Honesty

While students are encouraged to discuss labs and to use each other as resources, each student is responsible for his/her own work. In other words you can help each other, but you can’t copy any part of someone else’s work. The end product must be each student’s own individual work.

### Participation and Attendance

While participation and attendance are essential to succeed in this class, they will not be graded.

### No Show Drop

The college’s “no show, drop” policy requires that: during the first week students must complete at least one activity (a quiz or assignment) otherwise the student will be dropped from the class.

### Late Work

- Grades for lab production versions submitted after the due date will be reduced by 10%.
- No late assignments accepted after Tuesday of week 11, finals week.
- Code reviews, quizzes and exams cannot be taken after the due date. 
  Plan ahead! Exceptions will only be made for illness or emergency situations.
