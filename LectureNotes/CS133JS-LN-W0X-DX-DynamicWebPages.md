- Does anyone have any questions about anything?



## Odds and Ends

Topics we haven't covered yet.

- Primitive data types vs. objects

  > In JavaScript, a primitive (primitive value, primitive data type) is data that is not an object and has no methods or properties. There are 7 primitive data types: string, number, bigint, boolean, undefined, symbol, and null.
  > &mdash;MDN JavaScript Guide

  - Primitive types have object wrappers that are automatically invoked when you access a method or property that appears to be on a primitive.
  - Primitive types are immutable. Object methods return a new value, they don't change the primitive itself.

- Strings: methods, properties, and things you can do with them.

  - The String object
  - Interesting things you can do with strings:
    - Search within a string.
    - Replace sections of a string.
    - Split a string into two or more parts.

  - Example and lab ideas:
    - 

- Date object

- Math object

  - Random method

- Regular Expressions
