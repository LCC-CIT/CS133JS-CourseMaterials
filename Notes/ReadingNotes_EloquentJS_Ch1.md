## Chapter 1: Values, Types and Operators



The description of binary numbers is brief--may not be understood. Tell students not to worry.

### Values

Need to explain that the sea of bits he refers to is the computer's memory, not values. 

Note: 30 billion bits is 30 gigabits, which would be 3.75 GB of memory.

Need to explain *volatile* and *non-volatile* storage.

Is it correct use of terminology to say that values are not just numbers and text, but also functions?

### Numbers

Tell students not to worry too much about the discussion of how large a number can be stored.

### Arithmetic

Discussion of order of precedence--tell students it is the same as in normal algebra.

### Strings

The statement about backticks needed around the newline character if you don't escape it precedes the explanation of escape. Confusing--what is he showing inside the parenthesis?

Backtick quoted strings, sometimes called *template literals* can do a few more tricks. This is new to me.
`${100 / 2}` is new to me too.

###  Unary Operators

The - operator can be both a binary and unary operator.

### Boolean Values

### Comparison

Introduces the comparison operators without the if keyword.

### Empty Values

null and undefined are almost the same thing--according to the author.
