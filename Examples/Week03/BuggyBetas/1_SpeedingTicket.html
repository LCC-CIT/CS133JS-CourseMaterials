<body>
    This page will calculate the fine for a speeding ticket. The fine is based on these criteria:
    <ul>
        <li>Speed: Over by more than 5 MPH $100</li>
        <li>Speed: Over by more than 20 MPH $200</li>
        <li>Location: In the construction area fines are doubled</li>
    </ul>
    The fine will be $<span id="fine"></span>
    <script>
        var limit = prompt("What was the speed limit");
        var speed = prompt("How fast were you going?");
        var construction = prompt("Were you in a construction zone? (yes/no)");

        var fine = calculateFine(limit, speed);
        document.getElementById("fine").innerHTML = fine
    </script>
