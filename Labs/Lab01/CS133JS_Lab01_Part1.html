    <h1>CS 133JS, Lab 1, Part 1</h1>
    This part of your lab assignment is to run the examples in
    <a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/1st-ed/up%20%26%20going/ch1.md#try-it-yourself">
        You Don't Know JS: Up and Going, Ch. 1</a> in a browser console, then copy them to this HTML file and run them again there. Instructions:
    <ol>
        <li>
            Copy the code from the book to the console and run it. Experiment with it by changing the code so it produces different results, but still uses the same main JS feature.
        </li>
        <li>
            Change the calls that produce output from <code>console.log()</code> to <code>document.write()</code> so that the Output goes to the web page instead of the console.
        </li>
        <li>
            Copy and paste the code into the script element in the source code for this web page. Replace the comment <code>// put your code here</code> with your code.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <script>
        document.write("<h2>1. Try it Yourself </h2>");
        // put your code here that includes =, * and document.write

        document.write("<h2>2. Output </h2>");
        // put your code here that includes alert

        document.write("<h2>3. Input </h2>");
        // put your code here that includes prompt and document.write

        document.write("<h2>4. Operators </h2>");
        // put your code here that includes var, +, *, =, and document.write

        document.write("<h2>5. Converting Between Types</h2>");
        // put your code here that includes var, =, Number and document.write twice

        document.write("<h2>7. Code Comments</h2>");
        // put your code here that includes comments, var, =, and document.write

        document.write("<h2>8. Variables</h2>");
        // put your code here that includes var, const, =, *, +, String, toFixed and document.write
