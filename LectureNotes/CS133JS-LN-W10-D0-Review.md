# Overview of Week 10 - Review of JavaScript

This week is your opportunity to review all that we've covered in this class&mdash;both as preparation for the final quiz as well as a way to firm up your knowledge of JavaScript so you will be ready to write great JavaScript code in the future!

## Review Process

### On your own

**Lecture notes**
Review all the lecture notes and example code for the class, starting at week 1. If there is anything you are unsure about, copy the example code into a browser console and experiment with it. Modifying code to see what happens a great way to learn!

**Example apps**

Download the example apps and play with the code. Put breakpoints in it, and before you run it, try to predict what will be in the variables, then run it and when it stops at the breakpoints, see if you were right. Modify the code and experiment.

**Lab assignments**

Review the code you wrote for the lab assignments. Make sure you understand how everything works. If there are things you don't understand, look for answers in the class readings, lecture notes, or on the web and post questions in the Q and A forum.

### Together in Class

In class this week, I will go over topics that students have found challenging and give you time to work on lab assignments, review, and ask questions in class.

## Alternate Lab Assignment

For those who would like to re-do the array lab, there is an alternate array lab assignment. Even if you don't want to re-do that lab, you may want to do this as review.
