<!-- I'm using onload to load the doIO() function after the html page is loaded.
     This worked in Firefox, but to get it to work in Edge, and in Chrome on 
     MacOS, I needed to add the attribute, defer, to the script element.
     This doesn't work in Safari. In Safari the page still isn't rendered until
     after the JS prompts. -->
